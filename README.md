Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is explained intuitively in this project, along with the mathematics that supports it. It covers the reasoning behind the framework, the underlying assumptions, and the use of eigenvector decomposition to solve linear algebra problems. The course seeks to dispel the ambiguity surrounding PCA and its uses in data analysis and dimensionality reduction.
